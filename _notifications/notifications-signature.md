    ðŸ“Œ Notifications headers arrives with x-signature header, it includes the expected result hash. 
    
    #### How to obtain the signature
    - ##### Get the json notification payload from the request.

    - ##### Use your signature secret key to calculate the signature hash using HMAC algorithm with sha256.
    
    - ##### Encode the HMAC result using base64 and compare the result with the one provided on the x-signature header.
    
    - ##### Both hashes must match in order to consider the notification as valid.

    - ##### Process the notification acordingly and respond to Kibramoa with 200 status code.
