  The Cashier will allow the merchants to manage payments fast and safe :
  - A link to CashierUI will be generated for the merchant platform after session requesting.
  - To load the cashier the merchant would have to be boarded and generate an API key from merchant portal. This API key once generated needs to be used when calling the Kibramoa Gateway cashier.
  - The HTTP header needs to have the Merchant API key added before the cashier can be called. (described in section 4.1)
